THE WE LOVE ABBY WEBPAGE

Happy birthday Abby
19
I wanted to go for a poem sort of thing but that's kinda hard so I'll speak from the heart

Since spending so much time together I've grown so close to you to the point where you have become an extension to my life. It's all part of growing up I guess and who better to spend the journey with.

The memories, values, promises we share are some of the things I hold so close to myself, becoming the one thing to ground me firm on rougher days. Through the highs and lows in this cruel world you seem to be the only thing that makes everything just feel right

It's the little things we share that will always stick with me. We have been through so much together and hopefully in the future will be on the verge of another triumph.❤️
I know it's real when the "I miss you" feels a little different

Sometimes you can be an ass but...
No matter how hard loving you gets, I'm sure I'll find a way. I know we're both a lil different and sometimes it scares me.
Everyone's searching for that sense of normality. Tho ours may be in the extent of our uniqueness.

I just want to say thank you
I truly find you amazing, the anomalie to my life, the mystery I could never solve.
To that I say, cheers to many more memories, promises and the opportunity to feel emotions I have never felt before, for you are my mystery that I hope to never solve.


I love you Abby, I don't know where the future will take us, for good or worse I'm here for the journey, see you at the end my love.
